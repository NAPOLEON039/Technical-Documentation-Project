                <h2>Type selectors</h2>
                <p>HTML elements are written using a tag with some attributes like "class" and "id" which are quite common for nearly all elements. We can say that the <em>type</em> of
                an element is denoted by it's tag. Here are a few examples</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <div class="code-examples">
                            <code>
                                &lt;a href="#"&gt;Follow on Twitter&lt;a&gt; <br>
                                &lt;a href="#"&gt;Send an email&lt;a&gt; <br>
                                &lt;a href="#"&gt;Follow on Reddit&lt;a&gt; <br>
                            </code>
                        </div>
                        <p>Now to select all the links above, we need to target them using their <em>type</em>. We can do this using the tag.</p>
                        <div class="code-examples">
                            <code>
                                a { <br>
                                    &nbsp;&nbsp;background-color: green; <br>
                                }
                            </code>
                        </div>
                        <p>All links will get a background color of green since we have targeted them by type.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <div class="code-examples">
                            <code>
                                &lt;p&gt;This is a paragraph&lt;p&gt; <br>
                                &lt;div&gt;This is a div&lt;div&gt;
                            </code>
                        </div>
                        <p>Here, if we use the type selector "p", it will only target the first element and not the second, because they are both of different types.</p>
                    </li>
                </ol>
            </section>
            <section id="first-child_and_last-child" class="main-section">
                <h2>first-child and last-child</h2>
                <p><b>:first-child</b> and <b>:last-child</b> are pseudo-classes that make it posible to select the first and last child of a particular element.
                So if an element has 3 child elements, we can use :first-child to select only the very first child from the 3 child elements.</p>
                <p>Similarly, using :last-child will select the very last child element from those 3 elements. Here is an example:</p>
                <div class="code-examples">
                    <code>
                        <b>HTML:</b> <br>
                        &lt;ul&gt; <br>
                            &nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;li&gt; Number 1 &lt;li&gt; <br>
                            &nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;li&gt; Number 2 &lt;li&gt; <br>
                            &nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;li&gt; Number 3 &lt;li&gt; <br>
                            &nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;li&gt; Number 4 &lt;li&gt; <br>
                            &nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;li&gt; Number 5 &lt;li&gt; <br>
                        &lt;ul&gt; 
                        <br>
                        <b>CSS:</b> <br>
                        li:first-child { <br>
                            &nbsp;&nbsp;color: red; <br>
                        }
                    </code>
                </div>
                <p>In this example we apply the pseudo-class <i>:first-child</i> to a list element. The result would be:</p>
                <div class="code-examples">
                    <ul>
                        <li style="color: red;">Number 1</li>
                        <li>Number 2</li>
                        <li>Number 3</li>
                        <li>Number 4</li>
                        <li>Number 5</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
            </section>
            <section id="not_pseudo-class" class="main-section">
                <h2>not pseudo-class</h2>
                <p>The <b>:not()</b> pseudo-class is perhaps the most powerful of all pseudo-classes. It returns all elements that do not match the selection.</p>
                <p>For example, we need to select link elements but leave out those that have the class of "visited". In that case, the CSS would be something like this:</p>
                <div class="code-examples">
                    <code>
                        a:not(.visited) { <br>
                            &nbsp;&nbsp;color: green; <br>
                        }
                    </code>
                </div>
                <p>This will target all the links that <b>do not</b> have the class of "visited" and give them a font color of green</p>
            </section>
            <section id="selecting_specific_elements" class="main-section">
                <h2>Selecting specific elements</h2>
                <p>
                    :first-child and :last-child allow us to select the first and last child of an element. But what if we want to select another child besides
                    the first or the last? For that we have <b>:nth-child()</b>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Using <em>:nth-child()</em> we can specify a particular number and that child will be selected. Here is an example:
                </p>
                <div class="code-examples">
                    <code>
                        <b>HTML:</b> <br>
                        &lt;ul&gt; <br>
                            &nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;li&gt; Number 1 &lt;li&gt; <br>
                            &nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;li&gt; Number 2 &lt;li&gt; <br>
                            &nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;li&gt; Number 3 &lt;li&gt; <br>
                            &nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;li&gt; Number 4 &lt;li&gt; <br>
                            &nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;li&gt; Number 5 &lt;li&gt; <br>
                        &lt;ul&gt; 
                        <br>
                        <b>CSS:</b> <br>
                        li:nth-child(4) { <br>
                            &nbsp;&nbsp;color: blue; <br>
                        }
                    </code>
                </div>
                <p>And this is the result:</p>
                <div class="code-examples">
                    <ul id="nth-example">
                        <li>Number 1</li>
                        <li>Number 2</li>
                        <li>Number 3</li>
                        <li>Number 4</li>
                        <li>Number 5</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                <p>We can also select even or odd number of elements. Using the same example as above, we'll make changes to color all even elements only.</p>
                <div class="code-examples">
                    <b>CSS:</b> <br>
                    <code>

                            &nbsp;&nbsp;color: blue; <br>
                        }
                    </code>
                    <br>
                    <b>Result:</b> <br>

                <h2>Calculating specificity of CSS</h2>
                <p>
                    CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. We specify rules that are used to apply effects to HTML elements. We can target an element or
                    a group of elements and apply <i>styles</i> to them. If we target multiple elements, then the style that is specified most recently is applied.
                    A similar example would be: if we keep a red-colored book on a table and then keep a green-colored one directly on top of the red book,
                    we'd see only the green book from above since the red one was kept <em>before</em> it and is hidden beneath it. In the same way, the most recent
                    style rule is applied when two rules target the same element. This is the cascading feature of CSS.
                </p>
                <p>
                    But before this, the specificity of the rule is checked. This means that the rule which targets an element more specifically, will get precedence.
                    Only when all rules targeting the same element have equal specificity that cascading is applied.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Calculating the specificity of a CSS rule is simple to remember. Specificity is denoted by 3 digits - <b>0,0,0</b>.
                    Counting the number of id selectors gives us the value of the first digit. So if we have a CSS rule like this - <pre>#code > #display {..}</pre>
                    then the specificity of this rule is <b>2,0,0</b>. <br>
                    The next digit is calculated by counting the number of class selectors, attribute selectors and pseudo-classes. If there are multiple of them
                    they simply add up. Let's see an example:
                </p>
                <div class="code-examples">
                    <b>CSS:</b> <br>
                    <code>
                        #heading .examples:first-child {....}
                    </code>
                </div>
                <p>
                    Here, we have one id selector (#heading), one class selector (.examples) and one pseudo-class (:first-child). That means the specificity of this
                    CSS rule is <b>1,2,0</b>. Now, for the final digit, we count the number of type selectors and pseudo-elements. Now let's see an example
                    to understand how to determine which rule will be applied when two rules target the same element.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Let's take an element with the class of <i>book</i>. Two CSS rules will try to apply color to it. The rule with the higher specificity will be used.
                </p>
                <div class="code-examples">
                    <code>
                        div#materials > .book { <br>
                            &nbsp;&nbsp;color: orange; <br>
                        }
                        <br>
                        #materials > .book { <br>
                            &nbsp;&nbsp;color: blue; <br>
                        }
                    </code>
                </div>
                <p>
                    In the first rule, we have one type selector (div), one id selector (#materials) and finally one class selector (.book). The specificity
                    of the first rule is <b>1,1,1</b>. <br>
                    The second rule has one id selector (#materials) and one class selector (.book) so it's specificity becomes <b>1,1,0</b>. <br><br>
                    This means that
                    even though the second rule should be applied because of cascading, since CSS first checks the specificity of the rules,
                    the first one will be applied and the element will have a color of orange.
